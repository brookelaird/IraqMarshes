# IraqMarshes
Hi there! This repository is home to created data layers, google earth engine code script, and final deliverables from my senior thesis in Geography. I am pleased to share my data so that others can learn about the wetlands of southern Iraq, and the devistating history of wetland draining that occured in the region. 

For any further information I can be reached at bclaird@middlebury.edu
