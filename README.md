# IraqMarshes

Hi there! This repository is home to created data layers, google earth engine code script, and final deliverables from my senior thesis in Geography. I am pleased to share my data so that others can learn about the wetlands of southern Iraq, and the devastating history of wetland draining that occurred in the region.

The code script where I conducted a raster overlay of the boundaries can be found [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/b839d089c03cfb52aea704f5684beae8)

Higher resolution copies of my maps can be viewed at an Open Science Foundation link [here](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/Y29WC)

For any further information I can be reached at bclaird@middlebury.edu
